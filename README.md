# GitSearchService-Application
Used Angular 4.3 framework to develop a Github Search Service web application that finds repositories for users based on keywords such as programming languages and project topics. I made use of the HttpClient Module and Github Search API to pipeline repository data into the web application. I then used RxJS Promises to perform asynchronous search queries to provide repositories matching the user's search entries. To display search results on the web application, I included Angular directives, both structural and attributive within the HTML framework.
